# Project-2-Energy Consumption in the United States

Project 2 - Monday/Wednesday Class
Do you do business in a state that has deregulated electricity or natural gas? If you do, you have an opportunity to choose an energy strategy that supports your business. When businesses can choose their energy pricing plan, they  can negotiate the inherent volatility of the wholesale market into opportunities for cost control, efficiencies, and other business goals. But to take full advantage of your energy opportunities, you should look beyond a simple comparison of rates and prices.

At first glance, shopping for competitive pricing offers from energy suppliers may seem overwhelming. Not every supplier provides the same information or even explains how they derived their pricing quote, making it hard for you to quickly identify the best offer for your business.

Before you start shopping, you should understand the variables that affect market pricing. The system is complex and continuously changing due to seasonal cycles and sometimes periods of extreme volatility. But if you understand the current and anticipated market conditions that affect energy prices, you'll be able to better choose the right strategy for your business.

In this project work, We have chosen to analyze energy consumption in the United States to determine which states consume the most energy and where energy production is the highest. We were interested in analyzing this because of the concept of energy management. 
There is a global need to save energy and the analysis on energy consumption determines energy prices, emission targets, and legislations. Monitoring and implementing a results-driven approach is an effective tool in energy management. Most of the principles that apply to businesses and other organizations are also applicable to homes. 
With more research, we were able to find a study that lists a four-step process that is applicable to home energy management. Residents can meter their energy consumption and collect the data, find and quantify opportunities to save energy, and target the opportunities to save energy. Energy management is a complex concept, which is what intrigued us on choosing this as a topic for this project.
